# FAQ-Accordion

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I can use any tools i like to help you complete the challenge.

Users should be able to:

    View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
